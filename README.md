# HCI_Prototyping

### Overview

Waste City Scout is a prototype application developed as part of an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) prototyping project. The goal of the app is to allow users to capture images of trash using their smartphone camera and mark the locations of trash on an interactive map. This enables better environmental awareness and can support community-driven cleanup efforts.


### User Experience Considerations

Simplicity: Designed to be intuitive and require minimal user effort.

Accessibility: Ensures readability and usability for a diverse audience.

Efficiency: Quick and easy marking of trash locations.

Future Improvements

Integration with databases to store user-submitted trash reports.

Adding a community feature for reporting cleaned-up locations.

AI-based trash detection for automated categorization.
